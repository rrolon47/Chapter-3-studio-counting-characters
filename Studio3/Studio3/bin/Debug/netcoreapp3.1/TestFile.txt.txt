C#
Loneliness
is like a dense grey cloud
in a clear, blue sky
and as reality reaps,
it rains - heavy as a burden.

Airborne -
despair becomes feathers
crashing to the sound
of C-sharp,

hitting the concrete
in silence - spinning
in disbelief.

And mortality -
invisible like puppet strings,
lingers in the clear sky
waiting for eyes to open.
